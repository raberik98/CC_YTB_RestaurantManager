# CC_YTB_RestaurantManager
I will build a simple web based app for a restaurant, to manage it's tables.
The App makes it easy for waiters and waitresses to manage which tables are free and which ones are takes.
The App also makes it easy to track the orders and which order came from which table.
The App may offer limited information and functionality for outside users who aren't in the restaurant.
It is possible to place orders through this App and the kitchen has a separate user interface to track the order in which orders came in and will include other functionalities.
